# RISC-V-Challenge
The goal of this repository is the implementation of a reinforcement learning agent, which will be deployed in an ESP32 SuperMini C3 with RISC-V architecture. The RL agent is going to play games (e.g. Battleship game, Connect Four, etc.) against other players. Start of this project: TBD
